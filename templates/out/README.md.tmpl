# Steampipe Export {{.Plugin}}

## Prerequisites
- A build of SQLite that supports extensions (default `brew` install has extensions disabled).
- A build of the steampipe_export_{{.Plugin}} (default `brew` install steampipe_export_{{.Plugin}}).

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

The `steampipe_export_{{.Plugin}}` tool is used from the command line and accepts various options and arguments. Here's an example of how to use it:

```bash
steampipe_export_{{.Plugin}} [flags] <table_name>
```

**Flags**

* `config`: Specifies the configuration file for the tool. You can provide a file path to load configuration settings.
* `limit`: Sets a limit on the number of rows to retrieve. Useful when you want to restrict the amount of data fetched.
* `select`: Lets you specify the columns you want to display in the output. You can provide a comma-separated list of column names.
* `where`: Allows you to define a WHERE clause to filter the data you want to query. For example, you can filter based on specific conditions.
* `output`: Allows you to select output format. Supported formats are `json`, `json line` and `csv`. Default is `csv`.

## Configuration
If you require [configuration](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/{{.Plugin}}#configuration) for the extension, you need to set this prior to loading the extension.

## Installation

- Copy the binary `steampipe_export_{{.Plugin}}` to a directory of choice.
- Run `make build plugin="{{.Plugin}}"
