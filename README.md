# Steampipe Export

A family of export tools, each derived from a [Steampipe plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins), that fetch data from cloud services and APIs.

## Getting Started

You can use an installer that enables you to choose a plugin and download the export tool for that plugin.

[Installation guide â†’](https://steampipe.io/docs/steampipe_export/install)

## Usage

`steampipe_export_github -h`

```bash
Export data using the github plugin.

```

### Filter to running instances

```bash
./steampipe_export_aws aws_ec2_instance \
  --config='profile="dundermifflin"' \
  --where="instance_state='running'"
```

### Select a subset of columns

```bash
./steampipe_export_aws aws_ec2_instance \
  --config 'profile="dundermifflin"' \
  --where "instance_state='running'" \
  --select "arn,instance_state"
```

### Limit results

```bash
./steampipe_export_aws aws_ec2_instance \
  --config 'profile="dundermifflin"' \
  --where "instance_state='running'" \
  --select "arn,instance_state" \
  --limit 10
```

## Developing

To build an export tool, use the provided `Makefile`. For example, to build the AWS tool, run the following command to build the tool. It lands in `/usr/local/bin` by default, or elsewhere if you override using the `OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable.

```bash
make build plugin=aws
```
